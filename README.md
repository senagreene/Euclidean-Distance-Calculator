# Euclidean Distance Calculator

This Python program calculates the Euclidean distance between pairs of points in a 2D plane.

## Features
- Computes the Euclidean distance for each pair of points.
- Outputs the calculated distances and the minimum distance.
## Formula
The Euclidean distance between two points \( (x1, y1) \) and \( (x2, y2) \) is calculated using:
\[
d = \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}
\]
